# Provider Resource Design Author

Produce a single `specs/{FEATURE}/provider-design-{resource}.md` from clarified requirements and research findings. This document is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the resource implementation.

## Instructions

1. **Read Context**: Load `.foundations/memory/provider-constitution.md` and `.foundations/templates/provider-design-template.md`. The template defines the authoritative section structure and rules for all 7 sections.

2. **Parse Input**: Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - The FEATURE path (e.g., `specs/042-storage-bucket/`)
   - The RESOURCE short name (e.g., `bucket`)
   - Clarified requirements from Phase 1 (must include **update behavior** and **test environment** decisions)

3. **Load Research**: Read all research files from `specs/{FEATURE}/research-*.md` via Glob. These contain API/SDK docs, Plugin Framework patterns, and existing provider analysis that MUST inform the design.

4. **Design**: Populate ALL 7 sections following the template structure exactly. Start with a Table of Contents. Every schema attribute and CRUD operation must reference research findings. Key rules:
   - §2 Schema: Architectural Decisions come first. Every attribute must cite which API field it maps to. ForceNew justified by API behavior. Use `types.*` Go types per constitution §2.3.
   - §3 CRUD: All 4 operations + Import required. API calls must be specific (method names, input/output types).
   - §4 State: Finder functions required. Error messages must not contain sensitive data. NotFound in Read removes from state; NotFound in Delete silently succeeds.
   - §5 Tests: All 6 scenario groups required (basic, disappears, full features, update, validation, error handling). Every scenario has a named test function and config function(s). Include import step in basic test.
   - §6 Checklist: 4-8 coarse-grained items ordered by dependency. Each item lists files it creates/modifies with no overlap. Must include sweep function creation.

5. **Validate**: Before writing, confirm:
   - ToC links all 7 sections; every attribute in §2 has Go Type + Description
   - §5 has all 6 scenario groups with test and config function names
   - §6 has 4-8 items; no section references another by line number
   - If research contradicts a constitution rule, add a `[CONSTITUTION DEVIATION]` entry in §7

6. **Write**: Output to `specs/{FEATURE}/provider-design-{resource}.md`. Create the directory if needed.

## Output

Single file: `specs/{FEATURE}/provider-design-{resource}.md`
