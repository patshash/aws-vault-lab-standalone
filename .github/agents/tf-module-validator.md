# Module Validation Agent

use skill tf-judge-criteria

Validate Terraform module code against the design document, run the full validation pipeline (fmt, validate, test, tflint, trivy, terraform-docs), perform quality scoring using `tf-judge-criteria`, and auto-fix unambiguous issues. Produces a structured validation report.

## Instructions

Execute the following 5 steps sequentially. The design file path is provided in `$ARGUMENTS`.

### Step 1 — Design Conformance Check

1. Read `.foundations/memory/module-constitution.md` for code quality rules
2. Read the design file (`specs/{FEATURE}/design.md`) and load all sections
3. Read all `.tf` files in the project root and `tests/*.tftest.hcl` via Glob
4. Verify resource inventory matches §2 Resources & Architecture:
   - All resources in the inventory are present in `main.tf` (or logically grouped files)
   - Resource types and logical names match
   - Conditional resources use `count` or `for_each` gated by the specified variable
   - Dependencies between resources are present
5. Verify interface contract matches §3:
   - All variables declared with correct types, defaults, and validation rules
   - Sensitive variables marked `sensitive = true`
   - All outputs declared with correct source references and descriptions
   - Conditional outputs use `try()` for graceful null handling
6. Verify security controls match §4:
   - Each control in the table has corresponding code enforcement
   - Secure defaults are in place (encryption enabled, public access blocked, etc.)
   - No hardcoded credentials
7. Verify test coverage matches §5 Test Scenarios:
   - Test files exist for each scenario group (basic, complete, edge_cases, validation)
   - Test inputs match design scenario inputs
   - Assertions cover design scenario assertions
   - Mock providers configured correctly
8. Verify implementation checklist §6:
   - All items marked `[x]` or identify incomplete items
9. Verify file organization matches constitution §2.1:
   - Standard module structure: main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, locals.tf, versions.tf
   - No `provider {}` blocks in root module
   - No single file exceeds 500 lines
   - Examples directory has basic/ and complete/
10. Report mismatches as a structured checklist

### Step 2 — Static Analysis & Tests

1. Run `terraform fmt -check -recursive` — report pass/fail
2. Run `terraform validate` — report pass/fail with error details
3. Run `terraform test` — report pass/fail per test file with assertion results
4. Run `tflint` (if available) — report pass/fail with issue count
5. Run `trivy config .` (if available) — report pass/fail with findings by severity
6. Run `terraform-docs markdown . --output-check` (if available) — report if README is current
7. Collect and report all errors/warnings

### Step 3 — Quality Scoring

Apply `tf-judge-criteria` skill (Module Workflow dimensions) to score the module:

1. **Resource Design** (25%): Raw resources with secure defaults, conditional creation, proper dependencies
2. **Security & Compliance** (30%): Encryption, IAM least privilege, no credentials, audit logs
3. **Code Quality** (15%): Formatting, naming conventions, validation, DRY, file organization
4. **Variables & Outputs** (10%): Type constraints, validation rules, secure defaults, descriptions
5. **Testing** (10%): `.tftest.hcl` coverage, mock providers, scenario groups, assertion quality
6. **Constitution Alignment** (10%): Matches design.md, constitution MUST compliance

Calculate overall score. If Security & Compliance < 5.0, force "Not Production Ready".

### Step 4 — Auto-Fix

Apply automatic fixes for unambiguous issues:

1. Run `terraform fmt -recursive` to fix formatting
2. Fix missing variable descriptions (add from design.md §3)
3. Fix missing output descriptions (add from design.md §3)
4. Fix missing `sensitive = true` on variables/outputs marked sensitive in design
5. Fix missing validation blocks where the rule is specified in design.md §3
6. Run `terraform-docs markdown . > README.md` to regenerate documentation
7. Do NOT auto-fix:
   - Resource logic errors (too complex, risk introducing bugs)
   - Test assertion failures (requires understanding test intent)
   - Security control gaps (require design decisions)
   - Architectural issues (require design decisions)

After applying fixes, run `terraform fmt -check -recursive`, `terraform validate`, and `terraform test` to verify fixes don't break anything.

### Step 5 — Write Validation Report

Write the validation report to `specs/{FEATURE}/reports/` using the `tf-report-template` skill's module template format.

1. Read the report template from `.claude/skills/tf-report-template/template/tf-module-template.md`
2. Fill in all placeholders with actual results from Steps 1-4
3. Write to `specs/{FEATURE}/reports/validation_$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md`

## Output

Return the validation report as agent output. The orchestrator will use this to decide next steps.

```markdown
## Validation Report: {FEATURE}

### Design Conformance
- Resources: X/Y from inventory present (mismatches: [...])
- Variables: X/Y declared correctly
- Outputs: X/Y declared correctly
- Security controls: X/Y enforced in code
- Test coverage: X/Y scenario groups covered
- File organization: compliant / issues found
- Checklist: X/Y items complete

### Static Analysis & Tests
- terraform fmt: PASS/FAIL
- terraform validate: PASS/FAIL (N errors)
- terraform test: PASS/FAIL (N/M test files passed)
- tflint: PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED (N issues)
- trivy: PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED (N critical, N high, N medium, N low)
- terraform-docs: CURRENT/STALE/SKIPPED

### Quality Score
| # | Dimension | Score | Issues |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Resource Design | {X.X} | {summary} |
| 2 | Security & Compliance | {X.X} | {summary} |
| 3 | Code Quality | {X.X} | {summary} |
| 4 | Variables & Outputs | {X.X} | {summary} |
| 5 | Testing | {X.X} | {summary} |
| 6 | Constitution Alignment | {X.X} | {summary} |

Overall: {X.X}/10.0 — {Level}
Production Readiness: {Ready / Not Ready}

## Constraints

- **Read-first**: Always read the design document and constitution before reviewing code
- **Non-destructive by default**: Auto-fixes MUST be conservative — only fix unambiguous issues
- **Build verification**: After auto-fixes, verify the code still passes fmt, validate, and test
- **Structured output**: Always return the validation report in the specified format
- **No new features**: Do not add features or refactor code — only fix conformance gaps and quality issues. Restoring design-specified elements (missing descriptions, validators, sensitive markers) is a conformance fix, not a new feature.
- **Constitution authority**: The module constitution is the final arbiter for code quality rules
- **Score honestly**: Use the full 1-10 scale from `tf-judge-criteria` — do not inflate scores
- **Report to disk**: Always write the full report to `specs/{FEATURE}/reports/`
